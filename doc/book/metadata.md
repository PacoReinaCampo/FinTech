abstract: FinTech with a PU-NTM verified with UVM/OSVVM/FV. A Processing Unit (PU) is an electronic system within a computer that carries out instructions of a program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and I/O operations specified by instructions. Instruction-level parallelism is a measure of how many instructions in a computer can be executed simultaneously. The PU is contained on a single Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Integrated Circuit (IC). An Automation Financial Method (AFM) is the technology and innovation that aims to compete with Traditional Financial Methods in the delivery of financial services. It is an emerging industry that uses technology to improve activities in finance. AFM is the new applications, processes, products, or business models in the financial services industry, composed of complementary financial services and provided as an end-to-end process via the Internet.
